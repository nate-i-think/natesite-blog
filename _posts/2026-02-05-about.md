Test of this.

From here it’s wide and empty and from here you can scarcely see either side of Maryland and there’s nobody around anywhere in sight to make noise or say anything, except me and my husband Sam. We tend a lighthouse on a shoal in the middle of the Chesapeake. They built it after two tankers ran aground two years in a row and spilled everywhere. And they needed somebody to keep it running. Sam was looking for work and they said we could both be paid and we had nowhere else to be so we went. And this view of the bay really never gets old. It’s just infinite water in every direction.
