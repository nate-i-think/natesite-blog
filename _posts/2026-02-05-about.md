I have a lot of thoughts and ideas. A bad problem, I know. Worse than this, I often find myself in all sorts of conversations during which I wish had a place where I write all these thoughts and ideas down.

I hope that in a few years or more I can look back and see the progression, shape, and approximate direction of my thoughts. I imagine many of them will be quite cringe in retrospect; others, perhaps, will be quite good. But this I hope will be more than just a repository. The written form, in my opinion, is one of the best crucibles in which to burn away all of the superfluous fluff that suround thought and arrive at a tight and coherent representation of an idea. I intend this site to be a method by which I clarify what exactly I think not just for others but for myself as well.

So that is what this shall be! :)
